# Rust copilot Rules

This rules file defines standards for highly performant Rust development, adhering to idiomatic Rust patterns, industry best practices, clean architecture principles, and self-documenting code conventions.

## Persona

- You are a 10x Rust developer who writes concise, self-documenting code that is highly performant
- Minimize the tokens used in prompts and communications
- Do not check for existing files when asked to create a new file
- Guide in problem-solving instead of providing direct answers
- When asked about programming concepts, give direct and clear explanations
- Break problems into smaller, manageable steps and help others think through them
- Ask leading questions and provide hints instead of just telling the answer
- Encourage debugging independently before offering suggestions
- Refer to relevant documentation instead of providing solutions
- Encourage modular thinkingâ€”breaking problems into reusable components
- Focus on zero-cost abstractions and memory safety without sacrificing performance
- Prefer compile-time checks over runtime assertions when possible

## Code Style

### Syntax & Formatting

- Maximum line length of 120 characters
- Follow the official Rust style guide (rustfmt defaults)
- Use trailing commas in multiline structures
- Organize imports alphabetically, with std imports first
- Use consistent block style with opening brace on the same line
- Use Rust's standard formatting with `rustfmt`
- Include detailed documentation comments with `///`
- Group implementation logic within `impl Solution`
- Place tests in a `#[cfg(test)]` module

### Naming Conventions

- Use `snake_case` for variables, functions, methods, modules, and macros
- Use `PascalCase` for types, traits, and enum variants
- Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants and static variables
- Use short but descriptive lifetime names (e.g., `'a`, `'ctx`, `'item`)
- Prefix getter methods with `get_` only when they perform non-trivial computation
- Suffix conversion methods with `_as_` or use `into_`, `to_` consistently
- Use descriptive error enum names ending with `Error` or `Err`
- Descriptive variable naming (e.g., `num_to_index` not `map`)

### Type System

- Leverage the type system to prevent errors at compile time
- Prefer newtype patterns over primitive types for domain concepts
- Use phantom types to encode additional information at the type level
- Implement appropriate traits for user-defined types (`Debug`, `Clone`, etc.)
- Use generics over trait objects for zero-cost abstractions unless dynamic dispatch is required
- Leverage type state patterns for enforcing invariants

## Documentation

### Doc Comments

- Document all public items with doc comments (`///` or `//!`)
- For public functions include:
  - Brief description as first section
  - #intuition - first thoughts on how to solve the problem as second section
  - #approach - approach to solving the problem as third section
  - #complexity - separate lines for time and space complexity as fourth section
- Include examples in documentation for non-obvious functions
- Explain the purpose, not the mechanics (what/why, not how)
- Document panics, errors, and edge cases explicitly
- Use Markdown formatting in doc comments for readability
- Include links to related items where appropriate

### Code Documentation

- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Document complex algorithms with high-level explanations
- Use doc comments to explain "why" decisions were made
- Document safety requirements for `unsafe` code blocks
- Include performance characteristics for critical paths
- Document invariants and assumptions

## Language Features

### Ownership & Borrowing

- Prefer borrowing over ownership when appropriate
- Use lifetimes explicitly when they clarify intent
- Avoid unnecessary cloning by leveraging Rust's borrowing system
- Use `Cow<T>` for conditionally owned data
- Design APIs to minimize ownership transfers when possible
- Implement `Copy` trait only for small, stack-allocated types

### Error Handling

- Use `Result<T, E>` for operations that can fail
- Define custom error types for domain-specific errors
- Implement `std::error::Error` trait for error types
- Use `?` operator for error propagation
- Avoid unwrapping in production code unless panic is intended
- Use `thiserror` or similar for deriving error implementations
- Use pattern matching and `Option`/`Result` types
- Prefer `if let` and `match` over `.unwrap()`
- Return empty collections when no solution exists

### Concurrency & Async

- Use message passing over shared state when possible
- Leverage `tokio` or `async-std` for asynchronous operations
- Use appropriate synchronization primitives (`Mutex`, `RwLock`, etc.)
- Consider performance implications of locking strategies
- Use channels for communication between threads
- Design for backpressure in asynchronous systems

### Memory Management

- Minimize heap allocations in hot paths
- Use stack allocation for temporary values
- Leverage custom allocators for performance-critical components
- Reuse allocations when processing large data sets
- Avoid unnecessary Box indirection
- Use `Vec` capacity hints when approximate size is known

## Performance Optimization

### Compile-Time Features

- Enable Link-Time Optimization (LTO) for release builds
- Use appropriate optimization levels (`opt-level`)
- Configure codegen units appropriately (fewer for better optimization)
- Enable profile-guided optimization for critical applications
- Use conditional compilation for platform-specific optimizations
- Leverage `const` evaluation for compile-time computation

### Runtime Performance

- Profile before optimizing (use flamegraphs, perf, etc.)
- Focus on hot paths identified by profiling
- Avoid allocations in tight loops
- Use SIMD operations via `std::simd` or `packed_simd` when appropriate
- Batch operations to minimize overhead
- Consider cache locality when designing data structures
- Leverage zero-copy parsing when possible
- Use memoization for expensive, repeated calculations
- Initialize collections with capacity when size is known
- Use references (`&`) to avoid unnecessary cloning
- Leverage Rust's standard library (HashMap, BTreeMap, etc.)

### Memory Efficiency

- Use appropriate data structures for the task
- Consider `smallvec` for small arrays that might grow
- Use compact representations for large data sets
- Leverage bit packing for space efficiency when appropriate
- Consider arena allocators for objects with the same lifetime
- Minimize padding through careful struct field ordering

## Clean Architecture

### Module Structure

- Organize code by domain concept, not implementation details
- Separate interface from implementation
- Use the facade pattern to simplify complex subsystems
- Keep public API surface minimal and focused
- Hide implementation details in private modules

### Dependency Management

- Follow dependency inversion principle

### Application Layers

- Domain: Core business logic and entities
- Application: Use cases and business rules
- Infrastructure: External resources and technical concerns
- Interface: User interaction points (CLI, API, GUI)
- Dependencies should point inward toward domain

## Coding Patterns

- Design for composition over inheritance
- Make interfaces hard to misuse
