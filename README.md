# Rust LeetCode Solutions

A comprehensive collection of LeetCode problem solutions implemented in Rust.

## Overview

This repository contains Rust solutions for over 500 LeetCode problems. Each solution is implemented with a focus on:

- Clean, idiomatic Rust code
- Detailed documentation and comments
- Optimal time and space complexity
- Test cases where applicable

## Repository Structure

Solutions are organized by problem number and title:
- `0001.Two Sum.rs`
- `0002.Add Two Numbers.rs`
- etc.

Each file contains:
- The solution implementation
- Documentation comments explaining the approach
- Time and space complexity analysis (in most solutions)
- Test cases for validation

## Usage

These solutions can be used as:
- Reference for learning Rust programming patterns
- Study material for algorithm and data structure concepts
- Preparation for coding interviews
- Examples of idiomatic Rust code

## Getting Started

To run any solution locally:

1. Make sure you have Rust installed (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Create a new Rust project: `cargo new leetcode_solution`
3. Replace the content of `src/main.rs` with the solution code
4. Add any necessary dependencies to `Cargo.toml`
5. Run with `cargo run`

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add a new solution or improve an existing one:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch
3. Commit your changes
4. Push to the branch
5. Open a Pull Request
